IMPORTANT: This project is intended only for authorized network load testing, research, and defensive/security education. Do NOT use this software to attack systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of this software may be illegal and unethical. See the "Responsible Use & Legal" section below.

## Overview
The Network Traffic Load Generator is a Python-based, multi-threaded tool designed to simulate TCP, UDP, and HTTP traffic for educational, testing, and research purposes.
It allows users to generate configurable traffic to analyze server performance, network behavior, and rate-limiting mechanisms in controlled environments.

Key Points:
- Supports TCP, UDP, and HTTP request generation
- Adjustable packets/requests per second
- Multi-threaded for high-volume simulations
- Intended strictly for ethical testing on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Helps network engineers, researchers, and students study server/network behavior under load

## Features

- Configurable load profiles for TCP, UDP, and HTTP.
- Adjustable connection/request rates and concurrency.
- Dry-run / simulation mode (no traffic sent) for validating configurations.
- Simple reporting/logging to help analyze results.
- Safety checks and target whitelisting to reduce risk of accidental misuse.
- Extensible design so defensive testing workflows and mitigations can be integrated.

## Quick start
1. Clone or download this repo to your machine:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/sahikk67/StormX-NetworkTool
   cd StormX-NetworkTool
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the tool:
```bash
python "StormX-NetworkTool.py" 
python StormX-NetworkTool.py -h / --help
```
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Usage
To run the DDoS attack tool, use the following command format:
```bash
python StormX-NetworkTool.py <target_ip> <target_port> <target_url> <attack_type> <packets_per_second> <requests_per_second> <num_threads>
```
Examples : 
```bash
TCP DDoS Attack:
python StormX-NetworkTool.py 192.168.1.1 80 http://example.com tcp 1000 500 500
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UDP DDoS Attack:
python StormX-NetworkTool.py 192.168.1.1 80 http://example.com udp 1000 500 500
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP DDoS Attack:
python StormX-NetworkTool.py 192.168.1.1 80 http://example.com http 1000 500 500
```


## Notes & Limitations

- This tool is intended only for controlled environments, research labs, benchmarking, stress-testing your own servers, or systems where you have explicit written permission.
- Unauthorized use on public websites, government servers, corporate networks, or third‑party systems is illegal and may lead to permanent legal consequences.
- Network providers, hosting companies, and firewalls may automatically block, rate-limit, or log aggressive traffic generated by this tool.
- High thread counts or excessive requests may crash your own device, slow down your network, or cause your IP to get temporarily banned.
- HTTP, TCP, and UDP request behavior depends on:
- your system performance
- your internet speed
- the target server’s security configuration
- Some operating systems may require administrator/root permissions for creating a large number of sockets or threads.
- The tool does not bypass firewalls, WAFs, DDoS protection, CDN shields, or ISP rate‑limits.
- For educational and ethical use only — not designed for hacking or criminal activity.
